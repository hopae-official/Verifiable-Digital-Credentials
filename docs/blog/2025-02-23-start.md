# Project Background & Goals

## Why This Project is Started

While working in the Digital Identity field for two years, I identified several critical challenges:

- High adoption barriers due to technical complexity
- Limited scalability due to lack of interoperability
- Sustainability issues from complex configuration and maintenance

<!-- truncate -->

The root cause of these problems is the "lack of developer-friendly infrastructure". Current Digital Identity tools typically:

- Require complex configurations
- Demand deep understanding of underlying protocols
- Need manual security setups

## Project Goals

1. **Developer-First Experience**

   - Provide an instantly workable environment ('Simply Working')
   - Offer sensible defaults with minimal configuration
   - Enable progressive customization

2. **Zero Protocol Knowledge Required**

   - Provide simple APIs usable without protocol knowledge
   - Create an environment focused on business logic
   - Offer practical examples and documentation

3. **Security by Design**
   - Implement security as default
   - Provide clear security guidelines
   - Present safe customization methods

The ultimate goal is the democratization of Digital Identity technology. By creating an ecosystem where more developers can easily participate, we aim to make the benefits of Digital Identity accessible to more people. Just as developers can create web applications without deep knowledge of HTTP protocols, we believe implementing Digital Identity solutions should be equally straightforward while maintaining security and reliability.
